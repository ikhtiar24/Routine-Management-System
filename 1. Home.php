            <p>We have explore and implemented an automated information system for manage class routine for our institution. Our introduce system makes easy to use the manual system. It will be able to manage class schedule of  all the department in our institution by the modern computer. We think it will be helpful to provide all the information of the class schedule and status of the department in a quicker process successfully. In this system the teacher can choose session wise course and make  schedule of his/her class. He/she also can update status of his/her class schedule. The students can view class schedule status. The  admin can also see the all activities which are being performing in that system. And the admin also can add , delete, and update the information. </p>
